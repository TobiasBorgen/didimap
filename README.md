# DiDiMap (Diet Diary for Monitoring of low-FODMAP Diet App) is a project designed for making it easier to follow medical diets. The initial diet supported is the low-FODMAP diet.
# The mobile app supports capturing an image of a list of ingredients, and should return to the user whether each ingredient 
# has low/moderate/high amounts of FODMAP. The app will also include logging of previous meals.
# 
# The project relies on an accurate OCR engine for image to text processing of the ingredients.
